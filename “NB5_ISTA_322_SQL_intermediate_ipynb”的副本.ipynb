        "\n",
        "You've already been introduced to all these topics and learned how to code them in Python.  A fair question is: why do this in SQL vs. just doing it locally?  Well, two reasons.  For one, your data might just be too darn big to bring in locally, so it's more efficient to do this on the SQL server.  The other might be that even if your data is small it might be more efficient to do the bulk of the work on the SQL server and then bring it in locally.  Doing that would mean less data transfer and ultimately faster speed.  \n",
        "\n",
        "There are not strict rules regarding what you should do via SQL vs. Python, but I'd say it makes sense to do most of the simple selections, filtering, aggregations via SQL.  If you have to do more complicated work or a lot of exploration, it may pay to bring it in locally and work there.  But again, each situation is different so I'm not going to try and make a rulebook.  Use your best judgement.  \n",

        "* JOIN - You've seen JOIN before, and now we're going to do them in SQL.  They allow us to bring together different tables into one.  \n",
        "* Subqueries - Subqueries are, well, queries within queries.  You might want to get a query that meets a condition in one table, and then return only values from a different table that match that condition.  It's essentially query inception.  \n",

        "The obvious problem here is that this isn't dynamic.  What if you want a different genre?  You'd have to go and first do a query in `movies` to find out all the ID's that match, then hardcode them in this second query.  And if your data changes you'd have to update it.  Or, if your data are even remotely long it's just not possible to hardcode.  Remember that this full dataset has 67k movies, of which likely 1/4 are comedies.  You can't reasonably hardcode that so you *must* use a subquery!"
