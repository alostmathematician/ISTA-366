For example, hospitals might not update their stats on the weekends. Similarly U Arizona doesn't test on the weekends. This means that daily numbers aren't an accurate reflection of the overall trend, while weekly numbers are.\n",

The only issue is that if we want to add more data, every time you do you'd need to make sure the key you're giving a row hasn't already been used.
